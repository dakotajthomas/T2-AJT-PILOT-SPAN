<h1>WELCOME!</h1>
<p>
You have been invited to participate in a research study on second language acquisition. The purpose of this study is to investigate some of the properties of learning English as a Second Language.
</p>

<h1>DIRECTIONS: Sentence Intuitions</h1>
<p>
Speakers of a language seem to develop a <i>feel</i> for what is a possible sentence, even in many cases where they have never been taught any particular rules.
</p>
<p>
For example, in Spanish, you may feel that sentences 1-3 below sound like possible Spanish sentences, while sentence 4 does not.
</p>
<p>
    <b>1)</b>   <i>Hablo español cada día.</i>
<br><b>2)</b>   <i>Isabela y yo hablamos español cada día.</i>
<br><b>3)</b>   <i>Isabela habla español cada día.</i>
<br><b>4)</b>   <i>Isabela y yo hablas español cada día.</i>
</p>
<p>
Although sentences 2 and 4 are of the same structure, one can judge without depending on any rule that sentence 4 is impossible in Spanish.
</p>
<p>
Likewise, in English, you might feel that the first sentence below sounds like it is a possible English sentence, while the second one does not.
</p>
<p>
    <b>1)</b>   <i>John is likely to win the race.</i>
<br><b>2)</b>   <i>John is probably to win the race.</i>
</p>

<p>
On the following pages is a list of sentence.  We want you to tell us for each one whether you think it sounds possible in English. Even native speakers have different intuitions about what is possible. Therefore, these sentences cannot serve the purpose of establishing oneâ€™s level of proficiency in English. We want you to concentrate on how you feel about these sentences.
</p>
<p>
For the following sentences, please tell us whether you feel they sound like <i>very natural</i> sentences in English for you, or whether they sound like <i>not natural at all</i> English sentences for you. Perhaps you have no clear feeling for whether they are possible or not. In this case mark <i>not sure</i>.
</p>
<p>
Read each sentence carefully before you answer. Concentrate on the structure of each sentence. Ignore any problem with spelling, punctuation, etc. and try to imagine a context in which this sentence might be correct. Please mark only one answer for each sentence.
</p>
<p>
The following three sentences are practice items.  After the practice items, the experiment will begin.
